# BTD5 Patcher
Since I haven't really worked on NKHook5, I figured I wouldn't let the code I wrote for it become entirely useless. Most of the concepts and goals for NKHook5 were out of reach for me to do alone, and the result I wanted to make was quite complecated for a modding community who is used to modifying assets and leaving the game's code untouched. While this community was limited, there was never a clear and simple way for these modders to expand the functionality of the game in a simple way, which looking back is really what they needed all along.

This mod is here to achieve what I should have been trying to achieve this whole time.

# Bug & Feature reports
To report a bug or request a feature, send me a message on the NKHook5 discord. I'll take a look there. Make sure to **ping** me, not DM! (Bug reports and feature requests should all be public!)
